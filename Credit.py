    Calculates a player's base credit points based on their performance in a cricket match.

    Args:
        runs_scored (int): The number of runs scored by the player.
        balls_faced (int): The number of balls faced by the player.
        wickets_taken (int): The number of wickets taken by the player.
        catches_taken (int): The number of catches taken by the player.
        match_format (str): The format of the match (e.g., "Test", "ODI", "T20").  Case-insensitive.
